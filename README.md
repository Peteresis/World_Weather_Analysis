# World Weather Analysis
#### Unit 6 Challenge
During Unit 6 we learned to use several new tools to increase our knowledge of Python in Data Analysis.  The challenge makes use of all those new tools to create an application to help users plan their trips by finding hotels that meet certain criteria specified by a user, and create a map that shows an itinerary between cities selected by the user.

Some of the new tools learned are:
- Use of `random` library
- Use of `zip` object packs
- Use of `citipy` library
- Use of APIs from OpenWeatherMap and Google Maps
- Parse API responses
- Use of `datetime` library
- Use of JSON standard file format
- Use of `try` `except` blocks
- Plotting variables using scatter plots
- Use Linear Regression to Find the Relationship Between Variables
- Creation of Heatmaps
- Getting inputs for a user

Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. And, as with any new product, they’ve recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data you’ve already retrieved in this module. Then, you'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
