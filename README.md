# World Weather Analysis
#### Unit 6 Challenge
During Unit 6 we learned to use several new tools to increase our knowledge of Python in Data Analysis.  The challenge makes use of all those new tools to create an application to help users plan their trips by finding hotels that meet certain criteria specified by a user, and create a map that shows an itinerary between cities selected by the user.

Some of the new tools learned are:
- Use of `random` library
- Use of `zip` object packs
- Use of `citipy` library
- Use of APIs from OpenWeatherMap and Google Maps
- Parse API responses
- Use of `datetime` library
- Use of JSON standard file format
- Use of `try` `except` blocks
- Plotting variables using scatter plots
- Use Linear Regression to Find the Relationship Between Variables
- Creation of Heatmaps
- Adding `markers` and `info box templates`
- Getting inputs for a user

## Overview of Project
The project's program follows the steps below:
1. Generates 1500 pairs of coordinates generated at random
2. Uses OpenWeatherMap to retrieve the names of the cities located in the vicinity of each pair of coordinates
3. Uses OpenWeatherMap to retrieve the weather information of each city 
4. Deletes the coordinate pairs that do not have a city associated with them
5. Uses Google Maps to retrieve hotel information for each city within a 5000 metre radius
6. Plots a world map with markers showing the locations of each hotel obtained from the Google Map search
7. Plots a map showing the travel itinerary between four cities among the list of cities generated by the program

## Data Source Information
Using the OpenWeatherMap API, it was possible to build a dataframe with the name, country, latitude, longitude, max temperature, humidity, cloudiness and weather description for each of the cities randomly generated, as shown in this screenshot:
