# World Weather Analysis

#### Unit 6 Challenge

During Unit 6 we learned to use several new tools to increase our knowledge of Python in Data Analysis.  The challenge makes use of all those new tools to create an application to help users plan their trips by finding hotels that meet certain criteria specified by a user, and create a map that shows an itinerary between cities selected by the user.

Some of the new tools learned are:
- Use of `random` library
- Use of `zip` object packs
- Use of `citipy` library
- Use of APIs from OpenWeatherMap and Google Maps
- Parse API responses
- Use of `datetime` library
- Use of JSON standard file format
- Use of `try` `except` blocks
- Plotting variables using scatter plots
- Use Linear Regression to Find the Relationship Between Variables
- Creation of Heatmaps
- Adding `markers` and `info box templates`
- Getting inputs for a user

## Overview of Project
The project's program follows the steps below:
1. Generates 1500 pairs of coordinates generated at random
2. Uses OpenWeatherMap to retrieve the names of the cities located in the vicinity of each pair of coordinates
3. Uses OpenWeatherMap to retrieve the weather information of each city 
4. Deletes the coordinate pairs that do not have a city associated with them
5. Uses Google Maps to retrieve hotel information for each city within a 5000 metre radius
6. Plots a world map with markers showing the locations of each hotel obtained from the Google Map search
7. Plots a map showing the travel itinerary between four cities among the list of cities generated by the program

## Data Source Information
Using the OpenWeatherMap API, it was possible to build a dataframe with the name, country, latitude, longitude, max temperature, humidity, cloudiness and weather description for each of the cities randomly generated, as shown in this screenshot:

The information gathered in the `Cities DataFrame` was utilized to acquire hotel information for each city via Google Maps API calls. Once the hotel name for each city was obtained, the data from Google Maps was coupled with the data from OpenWeatherMap to build a new DataFrame. This time, however, the DataFrame was filtered using the user-selected Max and Min Temperatures.

The new DataFrame contains the city name, country, max temperature, current weather description, latitude, longitude, and hotel name

Once all the information was collected and organized, it was possible to plot the location of all the hotels listed in the Hotels DataFrame by making calls to the API of Google Maps.  The result is shown in the following image:

The next stage was to select four cities from the map above and use Google Maps' `Directions API` to trace a route that began in one city, passed through three others, and returned to the starting location. The following image depicts a path connecting the argentinian cities of Ushuaia (beginning point), Comodoro Rivadavia, Mar Del Plata, and San Luis:

## Conclusions

There is an abundance of data available online that can be used for a variety of purposes either for data analysis or general computer programming. However, since the information is made available to programmers through the use of APIs, learning how to programmatically obtain information from an API and then parse the information retrieved to extract only those snippets of information that are useful for our work is critical to becoming a programmer with a solid foundation.
